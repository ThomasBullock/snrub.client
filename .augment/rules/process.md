# Process

## Development Style

- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.
- Use primeVue components whenever possible
  - Reference PrimeVue's LLM-optimized docs: https://primevue.org/llms/
  - Component docs available in Markdown: https://primevue.org/{component}.md
- Use tailwind (version 3) helper classes
- Follow best practices for enterprise software. type interfaces should be in types/ they should be derived from constants when appropriate. Re-used patterns should be moved out of componenets into composables

## No Speculative or "Convenience" Code

- **Do NOT add code that is not immediately used.** Every line of code you write must be called or referenced by existing code.
- **Do NOT add re-exports, or abstractions "for convenience"** unless explicitly requested.
- **Consult with user before adding** helper functions, utility wrappers.
- **Do NOT anticipate future needs.** Write only what is required to complete the current task.
- **Follow existing project patterns exactly.** Do not introduce new patterns, conventions, or "improvements" without consultation with the user.

If you write code, something must call it. If nothing calls it, don't write it.
