# In a Dockerfile, the AS keyword is used to name a build stage. In the line FROM node:20.9.0 as dev, it defines a build stage based on the node:20.9.0 image and names this stage dev. This allows you to refer to this particular stage later in the Dockerfile, especially useful in multi-stage builds where you might want to copy artifacts from one stage to another or to target a specific stage for building.
